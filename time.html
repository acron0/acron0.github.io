        The rest of this message is just my opinion about the series of events leading up to this point. Please be aware that I am hurt, disgruntled and sad, so this is inflammatory. Feel free to skip it, but as a parent at the school I feel this needs awareness.

We have been in regular communication with school regarding JJ's progress and development as he needed some extra support due to an early childhood trauma that was, of course, not his fault. We worked with the school and members of staff to put in place a support plan, to try to make JJ feel safe at school. We also introduced the school to various external agencies, arranged and provisioned entirely by us. There were observations and reports. At no point was it established that JJ was "beyond" the kinds of services that the school could or were willing to provide.

Despite our efforts, at a certain point in time it began to feel like the school weren't that interested in making any of the recommended changes that would improve JJ's experience during his time there. Training literature was provided, free of charge, yet largely ignored. Workshops and seminars were offered, free of change, yet the school inexplicably chose to decline them. We worked very hard to make his place at the school feel smooth, for everyone involved, so this reluctance was hard to understand.

An incident occurred three weeks ago which lead to JJ being picked up from school in the middle of the day. Initially the feedback was as you'd expect: it was for his own good, it's unfortunate, it happens, he's welcome back straight away. However, this single event, in the history of his entire time at the school, became the central justification behind his expulsion. The school became fixated on it and then began to weaponise all the observations and reports that had been created to help JJ, as "evidence" that he didn't really belong there. Quite quickly, the message became that they "cannot meet his needs". We're still waiting for any elaboration beyond that.

I feel shocked. The step change that we've experienced in the last three weeks has shaken me and my opinions on a few key members of staff - one in particular. The meetings were disorganised, poorly structured. Some of the staff in question had no idea about what procedure was being followed, what the policies were, what other outcomes there could possibly be other than the complete destruction of a small boy's environment. His routine, his personal and social life, his perception of the world and his place in it. As an ex-foster carer I have interacted with a lot of professionals in education and even I was surprised by, in my opinion, the lack of empathy or even willingness to engage. But they are a private school, so they can do what they like, in whatever way they want and there is no recourse for us.

So here we are. Huge changes to our lives in the next few weeks and months, and it all feels so unfair and so unjust. JJ has been massively let down by an institution we put our trust and energy into supporting, and it's painful.
